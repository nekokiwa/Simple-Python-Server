# Simple Python Server
## A simple server/client program written in python.

Run *network_server_main.py* to start the server. It includes a terminal interface to run some basic commands.
Run *network_client.py* to connect to a server using ip and port. It uses a terminal interface to send commands to a server. While it is built to connect to the included server, it can be used to connect to any text based server, though ineffectively in most cases.

Anything under the *downloadable* (or configured using *configfile.py*) directory can be downloaded by a client using the download command, and should not contain sensitive data
